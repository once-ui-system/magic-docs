Once UI provides a comprehensive set of components designed to help you build beautiful, accessible, and responsive user interfaces. This guide introduces the key components and shows how to use them in your projects.

## Component Philosophy

Our components follow these design principles:

1. **Accessibility First**: All components are built with accessibility in mind
2. **Responsive by Default**: Components adapt to different screen sizes
3. **Customizable**: Flexible props system allows for extensive customization
4. **Consistent**: Unified design language across all components

## Key Components

Here's a quick overview of some of our most commonly used components:

<Table data={{
  headers: [
    {content: "Component"}, 
    {content: "Purpose"}, 
    {content: "Key Features"}
  ],
  rows: [
    ["Card", "Container for related content", "Flexible layout, hover states, interactive options"],
    ["Accordion", "Collapsible content sections", "Animated transitions, keyboard accessibility"],
    ["Feedback", "User notifications", "Multiple variants (success, error, warning, info)"],
    ["Media", "Enhanced image display", "Lazy loading, aspect ratio control, zoom capability"]
  ]
}} />

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of using our components together:

```tsx
<Card padding="m" radius="l" shadow="m">
  <Media src={image} alt={title} aspectRatio="16/9" />
  <Text variant="heading-strong-m">{title}</Text>
  <Text variant="body-default-s">{description}</Text>
</Card>
```

In the following sections, we'll explore each component in detail.
